# beginner-projects-py
in this repository is all the projects I've made to make my self a good programmer in python. project based learning teach you a lot more then tutorials. so these are the projects i built when i started learning python.

all the projects in here are beginner level and shouldn't take more the half an hour. so i suggest geting the idea from this and then trying to build at your own and then if you get stuck come back here and view the code.
